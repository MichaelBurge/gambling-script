gambling-script
===============
A friend told me that some people running a study gave 40 Ph.D students a positive EV game and observed that only 2 of them came out ahead. My first impulse was to gamble half your money each time, and if you really want to minimize losses to stop after you come out ahead. The author said the 'best' strategy was to gamble 20% each time.

From this script, I'm led to conclude:

* If you want to minimize losses, gamble very close to 0% and stop after you win.
* If you want to maximize EV, gamble as much money as you possible can and don't stop. You'll lose a ton of games, but the ones you do win you'll win big.

I can't justify the 20% number at all with this script. It appear to be related to the example in this Wikipedia article:
